\ixu 1.1.3

\dd Use this domain for words related to the wind. Some words refer to when the wind begins and ends. The wind changes in speed, so some words refer to how fast the wind is moving.

Some words distinguish a steady wind from a wind in which the speed keeps changing. Some words refer to when the speed of the wind becomes faster for a short time. A steady wind moves in a particular direction, so there are words that include the direction of the wind. The direction of the wind may refer to the points of the compass, a neighboring geographical feature or area, or the direction in which the speaker is moving. Some words refer to a wind that moves in a small circle, making a pillar of dust or a funnel-shaped cloud. Some words refer to what the wind does, such as when it moves or damages something. People can feel the wind, so some words refer to how it feels. The wind makes noise, so there are words that refer to the sound of the wind. In some cultures there is a relation between the wind and spirits, so some words may refer to the activity of the spirits in the wind, or that the wind brings disease.

\dd Use this domain for general words for all plants. Use a book of pictures to identify plant names and the scientific name. Languages divide plants into various domains that are not always comparable from language to language. Critereal features may be characteristics (trees and bushes are distinguished by size and number of trunks) and use (grass and weeds are distinguished by their desirability). A common distinction is between trees and non-trees, with trees described as being big, woody, and having a life expectancy of several years, while non-trees are small, non-woody, and have a life expectancy of typically not more than one year (Heine, Bernd and Karsten Legere. 1995. Swahili plants. Rudiger Koppe Verlag: Koln.). Agricultural societies will divide plants into wild and cultivated. However most plants for which there are names have some use. Therefore it does not seem helpful to divide plant names into domains for useful and non-useful plants. Since only parts of plants are eaten, edible parts of plants are listed under the domain 'Food'. Some languages may have more domains than are used in this list, others may have fewer. The classification system used here does not agree entirely with the system used by botanists. For instance botanists do not classify all the tree species together. The palm trees belong to the class Monocotyledoneae and are classified with lilies, bananas, and orchids. Apple and cherry trees belong to the class Dicotyledoneae and are classified in the rose family along with roses and blackberries. The acacia tree also belongs to the class Dicotyledoneae and is classified in the pulse family along with lupines and beans. However most folk taxonomies bring all the trees together. The scientific classification system for plants and animals is taken from: Carruth, Gorton, ed. 1989. The Volume Library, Vols. 1 and 2. The Southwestern Company: Nashville.

The mosses are small, green, flowerless plants that grow in moist environments and look like velvety or feathery growths carpeting the ground, tree trunks, and rocks. The liverworts are similar to the mosses with a flat and branching growth pattern. The algae possess green chlorophyll. They vary from one celled organisms, which sometimes live in colonies such as pond scum, to complex organisms such as seaweed. The fungi do not possess chlorophyll and feed off of other organic material. Lichens consist of a fungus and an algae growing together. They commonly grow on trunks of trees and rocks.

\dd Use this domain for the personal pronouns, including independent, subject, object, and possessive pronouns. It is best to collect all the pronouns in a chart. This way you are more certain of collecting them all and seeing how they are related to each other. A language may have more sets and more distinctions than English does, or it may have less. For instance some languages have a pronoun 'we' that includes the hearer, and another pronoun 'we' that excludes the hearer. Other languages have an indefinite pronoun that means something like the English word 'someone'. Many languages do not have the masculine (he), feminine (she), and neuter (it) distinctions that English has. It is necessary to determine the sets and functions of the pronouns for each language.

\dd Event propositions are similar in that they are normally expressed by a subject and a verb, possibly including an object, indirect object, or complement clause. However there are multiple ways in which a language can express an event, such as a passive construction, noun phrase, or subordinate clause. In addition each event type is different in its primary cases, and in the ways those cases are marked. Each event type has subtypes, such as intransitive, transitive, and bitransitive verbs. A great deal of research is needed in order to identify all the variations. Ultimately every verb must be investigated to determine how it behaves in each syntactic construction and how its case relations are marked. No two verbs are entirely alike.

The following definitions are taken from Bybee, Joan, Revere Perkins, and William Pagliuca. 1994. The evolution of grammar. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.
\qu (1) present: the situation occurs simultaneously with the moment of speech.
\qu (2) past: the situation occurred before the moment of speech.
\qu (3) future: the situation takes place after the moment of speech; the speaker predicts that the situation in the proposition will hold.
\qu (4) crastinal: tomorrow.
\qu (5) hesternal: yesterday.
\qu (6) hodiernal: today, normally with past.
\qu (7) pre-hodiernal: before today.
\qu (8) post-crastinal: after tomorrow.
\qu (9) ancient past: used for narrating events in ancient or mythical time.
\qu (10) remote: combines with other tense labels to indicate a situation occurring temporally distant from the moment of speech.
\qu (11) immediate: a meaning label that may be combined with other tense labels to indicate a situation not simultaneous with the moment of speech, but very close to it.
\qu (12) immediate future: what is about to occur.
\qu (13) immediate past: occurring immediately before the moment of speech. Also called the Recent Past. Do not use this label if there is any sense of current relevance--use anterior for that.
\qu (14) Immediate may also be combined with anterior or imperative.
\qu (15) expected future: the situation is to occur in the near future; what is scheduled to happen.
\qu (16) narrative time: the use of a form with no other past uses for reporting a past narrative.
\qu (17) gnomic present: the situation described in the proposition is generic; the predicate has held, holds, and will hold for the class of entities named by the subject, such as 'Elephants have trunks'.

The following definitions are taken from Bybee, Joan, Revere Perkins, and William Pagliuca. 1994. The evolution of grammar. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.
\qu (1) habitual: the situation is customary or usual, repeated on different occasion over a period of time. English 'used to' is past habitual; English 'Nancy sings' is present habitual.
\qu (2) continuous: a single situation is viewed as in progress, as maintained over a period of time; also called "durative." The English "Progressive" is a continuous restricted to dynamic words. English 'I am reading; *I am knowing the number'.
\qu (3) continuative: keep on doing what is being done. Restricted to dynamic words.
\qu (4) progressive: the action takes place simultaneously with the moment of reference, 'to be in the process of...'. This is more restricted than the English Progressive, which may be used for events that are not actually in progress at reference time: 'I am writing a book' may be used even if the speaker is not at that moment writing.
\qu (5) excessive duration: action is extended over a long period of time, longer than normal for that action.
\qu (6) limited duration: action performed for a relatively short or bounded period of time.
\qu (7) iterative: the action is repeated on one occasion; usually restricted to dynamic words, often further restricted to semelfactive words.
\qu (8) frequentative: action occurs frequently, not necessarily habitually, nor necessarily on one occasion, as is the iterative.
\qu (9) imperfective: the situation is viewed as unbounded in the sense that it is habitual, continuous, progressive, or iterative.
\qu (10) perfective: the situation is viewed as bounded temporally. It cannot be simultaneous with the moment of speech; in the non-past it is sometimes interpreted as future.
\qu (11) completive: to do something thoroughly and to completion, e.g. 'to shoot someone dead, to eat up'.
\qu (12) inceptive: the action or event begins. We are distinguishing this from the beginning of a state.
\qu (13) delimited: action is performed only a little.
\qu (14) The preceding terms or "Aspects" are not usually relevant to stative words.

\qu (1) state exists: the state is begun before reference time and continues after reference time.
\qu (2) state commences: beginning of a state of "becoming." Often called Inceptive or Inchoative. If there is a morpheme specifically for this meaning, it is usually derivational and restricted to stative words. However, it is also possible for "Perfects" or "Perfectives" to have this as their use with stative words.
\qu (3) state ends: state existed in the past, but no longer exists. Also a possible meaning of "Perfects" or "Perfectives" in combination with stative words.

The following definitions are taken from Bybee, Joan, Revere Perkins, and William Pagliuca. 1994. The evolution of grammar. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.
\qu (1) resulting state (resultative): action in the past produces a state that persists into the present.
\qu (2) anterior continuing: past action continues into the present: 'I have waited over an hour' ( = and I'm still waiting).
\qu (3) anterior: the situation occurs prior to reference time, and is relevant to the situation at reference time. This is different from a simple past or perfective, where the situation is reported for its own sake and independent of its relevance to any other situation.
\qu (4) A form that signals a situation that is prior to and relevant to a past reference time will be coded with two meaning labels, past and anterior.

\dd Use this section for verbal auxiliaries, affixes, adverbs, and particles that indicate agent-oriented modalities. Agent-oriented modalities describe internal or external conditions on a willful agent with respect to the completion of the predicate situation. They may be combined with any of the tenses, either in the same morpheme or in combinations of morphemes. The following definitions are taken from Bybee, Joan, Revere Perkins, and William Pagliuca. 1994. The evolution of grammar. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.
\qu (1) ability: the agent of the verb has the mental or physical ability to complete the action of the main verb.
\qu (2) ability, mental: English: 'Melissa can speak Dutch'.
\qu (3) ability, physical: English: 'Hortense can swim the English Channel'.
\qu (4) attempt: the agent attempts to complete the action specified by the predicate. Note: this has a sense of incompleteness, and I have seen authors call this "Incomplete" and gloss the examples with 'try'.
\qu (5) desire: the agent of the verb desires or wants to complete the action of the verb.
\qu (6) obligation: the agent is obliged to perform the action of the verb.
\qu (7) obligation, strong: it is absolutely incumbent upon the agent to complete the action of the main verb: 'I have to mail this letter today'.
\qu (8) obligation, weak: it is recommended that the agent complete the action of the main verb: 'Harry ought to get a haircut before meeting Sue's mother'.
\qu (9) permission: the agent is allowed to complete the action of the main verb: 'The students may check books out for two weeks'.
\qu (10) root possibility: it is possible for the agent to carry out the action of the main verb; i.e. s/he is able and external conditions allow it: 'You can get that kind of paper at Ulbrich's'.
\qu (11) intention: the agent intends to carry out the action of the main verb: 'Sam's gonna take Sanskrit next semester'.
\qu (12) andative: agent moves away from the deictic center in order to do something, literally 'be going to do something'. Of course such forms are often related to the verb 'to go' and also may have uses of intention and future.
\qu (13) venitive: the agent moves toward the deictic center in order to do something, literally 'be coming to do something'. This may be related to the verb 'to come' and may have future uses as well.

\qu (1) imperative: the verb form used for direct commands in the 2nd person. If there are also 1st and 3rd person forms, the meaning can still be that of imperative, with the 1st and 3rd persons being interpreted as 'Let us, let him...', etc.
\qu (2) optative: the proposition represents the speaker's will. Translated into English as 'May you prosper', 'May we all meet again.' with counterfactual: 'If only he had...', etc.
\qu (3) hortative: the speaker is encouraging or inciting someone to action.
\qu (4) prohibitive: the mood for expressing negative commands. The English is 'Don't'.
\qu (5) admonitive: the command constitutes a warning: 'you had better not...'.

\ixu 9.4.3

\dd Use this section for verbal auxiliaries, affixes, adverbs, and particles that indicate a subordinate clause. The following definitions are taken from Bybee, Joan, Revere Perkins, and William Pagliuca. 1994. The evolution of grammar. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.
\qu (1) subordinating: Often there are special verb forms or morphemes associated with the verb that occur obligatorily in subordinate clauses of certain types. The extent to which such morphemes can be said to have "meaning" varies, since they often co-occur with other markers of subordination. Their function is primarily to signal the type of subordinate clause.
\qu (2) Complement clauses: A main verb may take as its direct object a clause. These are often referred to as "Noun clauses" or "Noun complements". The verb form of the subordinate clause is usually determined by the semantics of the main verb, so in this case, our meaning labels will just refer to the context. If a verb form occurs in the complements to words of thinking and believing, the meaning label will be complement to words of thinking and believing.
\qu (3) complement to words of thinking
\qu (4) complement to words of believing
\qu (5) complement to words of saying
\qu (6) complement to words of ordering (in English we use an infinitive with these words)
\qu (7) complement to words of wanting (again in English these are done with infinitives)
\qu (8) complement to words of emotion (surprise, regret, happiness, sadness, etc.; the complement proposition is presupposed to be true)
\qu (9) complement to words of obligation
\qu (10) complement to words of admonition
\qu (11) subsequent: following a reference time in the past.
\qu (12) subordinator: marker indicates that the verb is in a subordinate clause.

\sd Conditional sentences
\ixu 9.4.3

\dd Use this section for verbal auxiliaries, affixes, adverbs, and particles that indicate a clause in a conditional sentence. The following definitions are taken from Bybee, Joan, Revere Perkins, and William Pagliuca. 1994. The evolution of grammar. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.
\ex if
\qu (1) Conditional sentences: Conditional sentences consist of two clauses, the 'if'-clause or protasis (which is a subordinate clause) and the 'then'-clause or apodosis (which is the main clause). Both of these clauses may take special verb forms. (Interestingly enough, they sometime both take the same special verb forms.)
\qu (2) There are at least three types of conditional sentences. (Labels, explanations, and examples from Li and Thompson 1981): [Li, Charles N., and Sandra A. Thompson. 1981. Mandarin Chinese: A functional reference grammar. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.]
\qu (3) reality condition: a conditional relation between two propositions referring to the so-called real world: 'If you see my sister, you will know that she is pregnant'.
\qu (4) hypothetical: the situation is unreal or imagined, but one that could be true: 'If we moved, we could have a garden'.
\qu (5) counterfactual: the proposition describes an unreal or imagined situation that could have been true but was not: 'If you had taken algebra, you would know this formula' (but you did not).
\qu (6) The verb forms that occur in these sentences will be coded according to the type of sentence, and according to which clause of the sentence they occur in.
\qu (7) Example: the English 'had' + past participle would be coded as:
\qu (8) meaning label:  protasis
\qu (9) meaning label: counterfactual
\qu (10) Since the conjunction 'if' obligatorily occurs in the protasis, there will also be the following:
\qu (11) Co-occurrence restriction: 'if'
\qu (12) This indicates that a morpheme meaning 'if' obligatorily occurs in the protasis. If no such morpheme is necessary, then there will be no co-occurrence restriction.

\qu (1) There are a variety of adverbial clauses (other than conditional clauses) that sometimes require a special verb form. The meaning labels for these uses are coded according to the type of clause (purpose, concessive, etc.), whether any particular temporal deixis is part of the meaning, and under "co-occurrence restrictions," whether a particular conjunction is present. The types of clauses we might run into are:
\qu (2) purpose: the clause states the purpose for which the main clause action is taking place. Often called a "final" clause: 'He was saving his money so that his son could go to college'.
\ex so that
\qu (3) concessive: translated in English as 'although, even though, despite the fact that': 'She was saving her money, even though she was a wealthy woman'.

The following definitions are taken from Bybee, Joan, Revere Perkins, and William Pagliuca. 1994. The evolution of grammar. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.
\qu (1) direct evidence: the speaker claims to have witnessed the situation, but does not specify the type of sensory evidence.
\qu (2) visual evidence: the speaker claims to have seen the situation described.
\qu (3) auditory evidence: the speaker claims to have heard the situation described.
\qu (4) sensory evidence: the speaker claims to have physically sensed the situation described. This can be in opposition to one or both of the above senses (i.e. any other sense), or it can indicate sensory evidence that is not further specified (i.e. any sensory evidence).
\qu (5) indirect evidence: the speaker claims not to have witnessed the situation, but does not specify further whether the evidence is reported or simply inferred.
\qu (6) reported evidence: the speaker claims to know of the situation described via verbal means, but does not specify whether it is second-hand, hearsay, or via folklore.
\qu (7) second-hand evidence: the speaker claims to have heard of the situation described from someone who was a direct witness.
\qu (8) evidence from hearsay: the speaker claims to have heard about the situation described, but not from a direct witness.
\qu (9) evidence from folklore: the speaker claims that the situation described is part of established oral history (e.g., mythology).
\qu (10) inferred evidence: the speaker infers the event/action, but does not specify whether the inference is based on observable results or on a purely mental process.
\qu (11) inference from results: the speaker infers the situation described from the evidence at hand (i.e. from the observable results of the causing event/action.)
\qu (12) inference from reasoning: the speaker infers the situation described on the basis of intuition, logic, a dream, previous experience, or some other mental construct.

\dd Each verb has a set of semantic case relations. For instance in the sentence 'I gave flowers to my wife' the verb give has three case relations. 'I' is the Agent, 'flowers' is the Patient, and 'my wife is the 'Recipient'. In this sentence the only word that marks a case relation is 'to'. English often marks case relations by their position in the sentence. Some languages mark case relations by affixes, prepositions, postpositions, and sometimes special verbs. To completely describe a language, each verb must be investigated, all its case relations must be identified, and all the ways in which these relations are marked must be described. Since verbs are often unique and unpredictable in their case relations, this information should go into the dictionary.

This is because there are so many of them, they are sometimes difficult to define, and it saves space in the dictionary. For instance place names can be included in a map. So it might be good to type the proper nouns into a special file.
